<h1>Master</h1><h1>3.0.2</h1><ul>
<li>correctly bump both bower and package.json versions</li>
</ul>
<h1>3.0.1</h1><ul>
<li>no longer include dist/test in npm releases</li>
</ul>
<h1>3.0.0</h1><ul>
<li><p>use nextTick() instead of setImmediate() to schedule microtasks with node 0.10. Later versions of 
nodes are not affected as they were already using nextTick(). Note that using nextTick() might 
trigger a depreciation warning on 0.10 as described at <a href="https://github.com/cujojs/when/issues/410">https://github.com/cujojs/when/issues/410</a>.
The reason why nextTick() is preferred is that is setImmediate() would schedule a macrotask 
instead of a microtask and might result in a different scheduling.
If needed you can revert to the former behavior as follow:</p>
<p>  var Promise = require(&#39;es6-promise&#39;).Promise;
  Promise._setScheduler(setImmediate);</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>2.0.0</h1><ul>
<li>re-sync with RSVP. Many large performance improvements and bugfixes.</li>
</ul>
<h1>1.0.0</h1><ul>
<li>first subset of RSVP</li>
</ul>
